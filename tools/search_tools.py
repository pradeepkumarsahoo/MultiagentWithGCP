# tools/search_tools.py
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This file defines the TOOLS that our LangGraph agents use to
#   interact with the outside world — the database, the memory layer,
#   and the vector search system.
#
# WHAT IS A LANGRAPH TOOL?
#   In LangGraph, a "tool" is a function that an agent can CHOOSE to call.
#   The agent does not call tools directly in code — instead, GPT-4o
#   DECIDES which tools to call based on what it is trying to find out.
#
#   Think of it like giving a detective a set of capabilities:
#     Tool 1: "Search the evidence database by meaning"
#     Tool 2: "Look up what I found about this sponsor before"
#     Tool 3: "Check if I have investigated this study before"
#
#   The detective (agent) reads the case file and DECIDES:
#   "I need to search for studies with missing results first,
#    then check the sponsor's track record."
#   It calls those tools in that order — autonomously.
#
# WHY ARE TOOLS DEFINED SEPARATELY FROM AGENTS?
#   Clean separation of concerns:
#   - Tools know HOW to fetch data (database queries, API calls)
#   - Agents know WHAT to look for and HOW to reason about findings
#   - Tools are REUSABLE — multiple agents can use the same tool
#
#   Example: search_studies_by_meaning is used by FIVE different agents.
#   If we put it inside one agent, the other four could not use it.
#   Defining it here makes it available to everyone.
#
# HOW LANGRAPH TOOLS WORK — THE @tool DECORATOR:
#   @tool is a LangChain/LangGraph decorator that transforms a regular
#   Python function into a tool that GPT-4o can call.
#   It reads the function's docstring to understand what the tool does.
#   It reads the function's type hints to know what parameters to pass.
#   GPT-4o uses this information to decide WHEN and HOW to call each tool.
#
#   IMPORTANT: The docstring is NOT just for human readers —
#   GPT-4o reads it to understand what the tool does.
#   Write docstrings as if you are explaining to the AI what this tool is for.
#
# SHOULD YOU RUN THIS FILE DIRECTLY?
#   No. Agents import tools from this file. Do not run it directly.

import asyncio
# asyncio is Python's async library.
# We use asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete() to bridge
# the gap between LangGraph's synchronous tool calls and our
# async database functions. Explained in detail below.

import json
# json is used to format tool outputs as clean strings.
# LangGraph tools must return strings — not dicts or lists.
# json.dumps() converts a Python dict to a JSON-formatted string.

from langchain_core.tools import tool
# @tool is the LangChain decorator that turns a Python function
# into a LangGraph-compatible tool.
# After applying @tool, GPT-4o can call the function by name,
# passing the parameters it decides are needed.

from processing.vector_store import VectorStore
# VectorStore gives us semantic search over study chunks.
# When an agent needs to find relevant study content, it uses
# the search() method from VectorStore.

from memory.episodic_store import EpisodicStore
# EpisodicStore gives agents access to past session memory.
# Agents search episodes at the START of every run to get context
# from what they found in previous sessions.

from memory.semantic_store import SemanticStore
# SemanticStore gives agents access to sponsor profiles.
# The Track Record agent uses this most heavily — checking
# credibility scores before generating signals.

##############################################################################
# SHARED STORE INSTANCES
#
# We create ONE instance of each store at MODULE LEVEL.
# "Module level" means outside any function or class —
# at the top level of this file.
#
# WHY ONE SHARED INSTANCE?
# Creating a new database connection pool for every tool call would be
# extremely wasteful — opening a connection takes ~100-200ms.
# With 6 agents each calling 5-10 tools per run, that is 30-60
# connection openings per analysis run. Very slow.
#
# Instead, we create ONE instance per store at startup.
# All tool calls share the same instance and its connection pool.
# The pool handles multiple simultaneous calls efficiently.
#
# WHY NOT CREATE THESE INSIDE EACH TOOL FUNCTION?
# Tool functions are called by LangGraph many times during one run.
# If we created stores inside each function, we would create and
# destroy connection pools on every single tool call — catastrophic.
##############################################################################

_vector_store   = VectorStore()
# One shared VectorStore instance.
# Underscore prefix = private — only used within this file.

_episodic_store = EpisodicStore()
# One shared EpisodicStore instance.

_semantic_store = SemanticStore()
# One shared SemanticStore instance.


##############################################################################
# THE ASYNC BRIDGE PATTERN
#
# LangGraph tools are called SYNCHRONOUSLY by the framework —
# LangGraph does not await tool functions.
# But ALL our store methods are ASYNC — they use await.
#
# This creates a conflict:
#   LangGraph: "call this tool function synchronously"
#   Our code:  "but our database functions need await"
#
# The solution is _run_async() — a helper that runs an async
# function synchronously by using asyncio.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
#   asyncio.get_event_loop()          → get the current async event loop
#   .run_until_complete(coroutine)    → run the coroutine and wait for it
#
# This bridges the sync/async boundary cleanly.
# Every tool function calls _run_async() to run its async database call.
##############################################################################

def _run_async(coroutine):
    """
    Runs an async coroutine synchronously.

    WHAT IS A COROUTINE?
    When you call an async function WITHOUT await, Python gives you
    back a "coroutine" — a suspended function that has not run yet.
    Example:
      result = store.search(...)      → coroutine (not run yet)
      result = await store.search(...)→ actual result (ran and waited)

    This helper takes that suspended coroutine and runs it to completion
    using the event loop — giving us the actual result synchronously.

    Args:
        coroutine: An unawaited async function call.

    Returns:
        Whatever the async function would have returned with await.
    """

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    # get_event_loop() returns the currently running asyncio event loop.
    # The event loop is the engine that manages all async operations.
    # LangGraph runs inside an event loop, so there is always one available.

    return loop.run_until_complete(coroutine)
    # run_until_complete() takes our coroutine, runs it inside the loop,
    # waits for it to finish, and returns the result.
    # It is the bridge between the synchronous world (LangGraph tools)
    # and the async world (our database functions).

#
# A list of all tools defined in this file.

# to each agent without importing them one by one.
#
# Each agent gets a SUBSET of these tools — not all of them.
# For example:
#   missing_results_agent → gets search_studies_by_meaning,
#                           get_sponsor_profile, search_past_episodes,
#                           save_episode, update_sponsor_profile
#   side_effect_agent     → gets search_papers_by_meaning,

#                           save_episode
#
# Giving agents only the tools they need keeps their reasoning focused.
# An agent with 20 tools available gets confused — it does not know
# which to use. An agent with 5 focused tools reasons more clearly.
